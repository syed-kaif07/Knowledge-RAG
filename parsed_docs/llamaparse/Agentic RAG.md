## ABSTRACT

Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by enabling human-like text generation and natural language understanding. However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real-time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real-time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multi-step reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows through clearly defined operational structures ranging from sequential steps to adaptive collaboration. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context-awareness across diverse applications. This paper presents an analytical survey of Agentic RAG<sup>1</sup> systems. It traces the evolution of RAG paradigms, introduces a principled taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures based on agent cardinality, control structure, autonomy, and knowledge representation, and provides a comparative analysis of design trade-offs across existing frameworks. The survey further examines real-world applications in domains including healthcare, finance, education, and enterprise document processing, and distills practical lessons learned for system designers and practitioners. Finally, it identifies key open research challenges related to evaluation, coordination, memory management, efficiency, and governance, outlining directions for future research.

# 1 **Introduction**

Large Language Models (LLMs) [1, 2, 3], such as GPT-5, PaLM, and LLaMA, have transformed artificial intelligence by enabling human-like text generation and natural language understanding. These models drive innovation in conversational agents [4], content creation, real-time translation, and multimodal generation tasks including text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis [5, 6]. However, a central challenge remains: how LLMs can reliably reason over rapidly changing external knowledge rather than relying solely on static pre-training.

Despite these advances, LLMs remain constrained by static pre-training data, often producing outdated responses, hallucinated content [7], and failing to adapt to evolving real-world information.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [8, 9] addresses these limitations by integrating external knowledge into generation at inference time. By combining LLM capabilities with retrieval mechanisms [10] over vector databases [11], APIs, or web sources, RAG improves factual grounding, relevance, and timeliness. However, traditional RAG pipelines are typically static and linear, limiting complex multi-step reasoning, deep contextual understanding, and iterative response refinement. These limitations motivate autonomous control mechanisms that dynamically decide when to retrieve, how to reformulate queries, and when sufficient evidence has been collected.

In parallel, advances in agentic AI [12] have introduced intelligent agents capable of perception, reasoning, and autonomous task execution [13]. These agents leverage design patterns—reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration—to dynamically decompose tasks and adapt strategies. Such capabilities are directly relevant to RAG, as retrieval and reasoning decisions can themselves be treated as agentic tasks. These patterns are further structured through workflow patterns [13, 14], including prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, orchestrator-worker models, and evaluator-optimizer loops, governing how multiple prompts, models, or agents are coordinated at the system level.

The convergence of RAG and agentic intelligence has given rise to *Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG)* [15], which integrates autonomous agents directly into the RAG pipeline to enable dynamic retrieval, iterative context refinement, and adaptive workflow orchestration [16]. This introduces an explicit control layer that guides how the system reasons over external evidence—coordinating retrieval, validating information, invoking tools, and refining responses—making Agentic RAG effective for complex, multi-domain tasks requiring precision and adaptability, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

Despite rapidly growing interest, the Agentic RAG field remains fragmented, with diverse architectures, inconsistent terminology, and limited comparative understanding. Existing work focuses on individual frameworks or application-specific implementations, and no unified taxonomy currently organizes Agentic RAG systems along principled design dimensions.

This paper presents an analytical survey aimed at structuring this emerging field. It reviews the evolution of RAG paradigms, including naïve, modular, and graph-based RAG [17], and their transition toward agentic systems. A principled taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures is introduced based on agent cardinality, control structure, autonomy, and knowledge representation, followed by a comparative analysis of design trade-offs. The survey examines applications across healthcare [18, 19], finance, and education [20], distills practical lessons for system designers, and identifies open research challenges to guide future work.

The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces RAG and its evolution, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches. Section 3 elaborates on the principles of agentic intelligence and agentic patterns. Section 4 elaborates on agentic workflow patterns. Section 5 provides a taxonomy of Agentic RAG systems, including single-agent, multi-agent, and graph-based frameworks. Section 6 provides a comparative analysis of Agentic RAG frameworks. Section 7 examines applications of Agentic RAG, while Section 8 discusses implementation tools and frameworks. Section 9 provides a comparative analysis of Agentic RAG frameworks. Section 10 discusses the lessons learned and practical guidance. Section 11 focuses on benchmarks and datasets, Section 12 discusses open research issues and future challenges, and Section 13 concludes with future directions for Agentic RAG systems.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, combining the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with real-time data retrieval. While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their reliance on static pre-trained data often results in outdated or incomplete responses. RAG addresses this limitation by dynamically retrieving relevant

information from external sources and incorporating it into the generative process, enabling contextually accurate and up-to-date outputs.

## 2.2 Core Components of RAG

The architecture of RAG systems integrates three primary components (Figure2):

- **Retrieval:** Responsible for querying external data sources such as knowledge bases, APIs, or vector databases. Advanced retrievers leverage dense vector search and transformer-based models to improve retrieval precision and semantic relevance.
- **Augmentation:** Processes retrieved data, extracting and summarizing the most relevant information to align with the query context.
- **Generation:** Combines retrieved information with the LLM's pre-trained knowledge to generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses.

## 2.3 Evolution of RAG Paradigms

The field of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has evolved significantly to address the increasing complexity of real-world applications, where contextual accuracy, scalability, and multi-step reasoning are critical. What began as simple keyword-based retrieval has transitioned into sophisticated, modular, and adaptive systems capable of integrating

diverse data sources and autonomous decision-making processes. This evolution underscores the growing need for RAG systems to handle complex queries efficiently and effectively.

This section examines the progression of RAG paradigms, presenting key stages of development—Naïve RAG, Advanced RAG, Modular RAG, Graph RAG, and Agentic RAG alongside their defining characteristics, strengths, and limitations. By understanding the evolution of these paradigms, readers can appreciate the advancements made in retrieval and generative capabilities and their application in various domains

## 2.3.1 **Naïve RAG**

Naïve RAG [21] represents the foundational implementation of retrieval-augmented generation. Figure 3 illustrates the simple retrieve-read workflow of Naïve RAG, focusing on keyword-based retrieval and static datasets.. These systems rely on simple keyword-based retrieval techniques, such as TF-IDF and BM25, to fetch documents from static datasets. The retrieved documents are then used to augment the language model's generative capabilities.

**Figure 3: An Overview of Naïve RAG.**

```mermaid

  N9[SimilarDocs] --> N10[Prompt]
  N10[Prompt] --> N11[LLM]
  N11[LLM] --> N12[Response]
```

Naïve RAG is characterized by its simplicity and ease of implementation, making it suitable for tasks involving fact-based queries with minimal contextual complexity. However, it suffers from several limitations:

- **Lack of Contextual Awareness:** Retrieved documents often fail to capture the semantic nuances of the query due to reliance on lexical matching rather than semantic understanding.
- **Fragmented Outputs:** The absence of advanced preprocessing or contextual integration often leads to disjointed or overly generic responses.
- **Scalability Issues:** Keyword-based retrieval techniques struggle with large datasets, often failing to identify the most relevant information.

Despite these limitations, Naïve RAG systems provided a critical proof-of-concept for integrating retrieval with generation, laying the foundation for more sophisticated paradigms.

## 2.3.2 **Advanced RAG**

Advanced RAG [21] systems build upon the limitations of Naïve RAG by incorporating semantic understanding and enhanced retrieval techniques. Figure 4 highlights the semantic enhancements in retrieval and the iterative, context-

  N9[F] --> N10[G Prompt]
  N10[G Prompt] --> N11[LLM]
  N12[G] --> N13[Response]
```

Figure 4: Overview of Advanced RAG

Key features of Advanced RAG include:

- **Dense Vector Search**: Queries and documents are represented in high-dimensional vector spaces, enabling better semantic alignment between the user query and retrieved documents.
- **Contextual Re-Ranking**: Neural models re-rank retrieved documents to prioritize the most contextually relevant information.
- **Iterative Retrieval**: Advanced RAG introduces multi-hop retrieval mechanisms, enabling reasoning across multiple documents for complex queries.

These advancements make Advanced RAG suitable for applications requiring high precision and nuanced understanding, such as research synthesis and personalized recommendations. However, challenges such as computational overhead and limited scalability persist, particularly when dealing with large datasets or multi-step queries.

## 2.3.3 Modular RAG

Modular RAG [21] represents the latest evolution in RAG paradigms, emphasizing flexibility and customization. These systems decompose the retrieval and generation pipeline into independent, reusable components, enabling domain-specific optimization and task adaptability. Figure 5 demonstrates the modular architecture, showcasing hybrid retrieval strategies, composable pipelines, and external tool integration.

Key innovations in Modular RAG include:

- **Hybrid Retrieval Strategies**: Combining sparse retrieval methods (e.g., a sparse encoder-BM25) with dense retrieval techniques [22] (e.g., DPR - Dense Passage Retrieval ) to maximize accuracy across diverse query types.
- **Tool Integration**: Incorporating external APIs, databases, or computational tools to handle specialized tasks, such as real-time data analysis or domain-specific computations.
- **Composable Pipelines**: Modular RAG enables retrievers, generators, and other components to be replaced, enhanced, or reconfigured independently, allowing high adaptability to specific use cases.

For instance, a Modular RAG system designed for financial analytics might retrieve live stock prices via APIs, analyze historical trends using dense retrieval, and generate actionable investment insights through a tailored language model. This modularity and customization make Modular RAG ideal for complex, multi-domain tasks, offering both scalability and precision.

**2.3.4 Graph RAG**

Graph RAG [17] extends traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems by integrating graph-based data structures as illustrated in Figure 6. These systems leverage the relationships and hierarchies within graph data to enhance multi-hop reasoning and contextual enrichment. By incorporating graph-based retrieval, Graph RAG enables richer and more accurate generative outputs, particularly for tasks requiring relational understanding.

Graph RAG is characterized by its ability to:

- **Node Connectivity**: Captures and reasons over relationships between entities.
- **Hierarchical Knowledge Management**: Handles structured and unstructured data through graph-based hierarchies.
- **Context Enrichment**: Adds relational understanding by leveraging graph-based pathways.

However, Graph RAG has some limitations:

- **Limited Scalability**: The reliance on graph structures can restrict scalability, especially with extensive data sources.
- **Data Dependency**: High-quality graph data is essential for meaningful outputs, limiting its applicability in unstructured or poorly annotated datasets.
- **Complexity of Integration**: Integrating graph data with unstructured retrieval systems increases design and implementation complexity.

Graph RAG is well-suited for applications such as healthcare diagnostics, legal research, and other domains where reasoning over structured relationships is crucial.

**2.3.5 Agentic RAG**

Agentic RAG represents a paradigm shift by introducing autonomous agents capable of dynamic decision-making and workflow optimization. Unlike static systems, Agentic RAG employs iterative refinement and adaptive retrieval strategies to address complex, real-time, and multi-domain queries. This paradigm leverages the modularity of retrieval and generation processes while introducing agent-based autonomy.

  N9[PromptAugmentation] --> N10[Answer]
  N10[Answer] --> N0[User]

```

Key characteristics of Agentic RAG include:

- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Agents independently evaluate and manage retrieval strategies based on query complexity.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Incorporates feedback loops to improve retrieval accuracy and response relevance.
- **Workflow Optimization**: Dynamically orchestrates tasks, enabling efficiency in real-time applications.

Despite its advancements, Agentic RAG faces some challenges:

- **Coordination Complexity**: Managing interactions between agents requires sophisticated orchestration mechanisms.
- **Computational Overhead**: The use of multiple agents increases resource requirements for complex workflows.
- **Scalability Limitations**: While scalable, the dynamic nature of the system can strain computational resources for high query volumes.

Agentic RAG excels in domains like customer support, financial analytics, and adaptive learning platforms, where dynamic adaptability and contextual precision are paramount.

## 2.4 Challenges and Limitations of Traditional RAG Systems

Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have significantly expanded the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating real-time data retrieval. However, these systems still face critical challenges that hinder their effectiveness in complex, real-world applications. The most notable limitations revolve around **contextual integration**, **multi-step reasoning**, and **scalability and latency issues**.

### 2.4.1 Contextual Integration

Even when RAG systems successfully retrieve relevant information, they often struggle to seamlessly incorporate it into generated responses. The static nature of retrieval pipelines and limited contextual awareness lead to fragmented, inconsistent, or overly generic outputs.

**Example:** A query such, *"What are the latest advancements in Alzheimer's research and their implications for early-stage treatment?"* might yield relevant research papers and medical guidelines. However, traditional RAG systems often fail to synthesize these findings into a coherent explanation that connects the new treatments to specific patient scenarios. Similarly, for a query like, *"What are the best sustainable practices for small-scale agriculture in arid regions?"*, traditional systems might retrieve documents on general agricultural methods but overlook critical sustainability practices tailored to arid environments.

**2.4.2 Multi-Step Reasoning**

Many real-world queries require iterative or multi-hop reasoning—retrieving and synthesizing information across multiple steps. Traditional RAG systems are often ill-equipped to refine retrieval based on intermediate insights or user feedback, resulting in incomplete or disjointed responses.

**Example:** A complex query like, *"What lessons from renewable energy policies in Europe can be applied to developing nations, and what are the potential economic impacts?"* demands the orchestration of multiple types of information, including policy data, contextualization for developing regions, and economic analysis. Traditional RAG systems typically fail to connect these disparate elements into a cohesive response.

**2.4.3 Scalability and Latency Issues**

As the volume of external data sources grows, querying and ranking large datasets becomes increasingly computationally intensive. This results in significant latency, which undermines the system's ability to provide timely responses in real-time applications.

**Example:** In time-sensitive settings such as *financial analytics* or *live customer support*, delays caused by querying multiple databases or processing large document sets can hinder the system's overall utility. For example, a delay in retrieving market trends during high-frequency trading could result in missed opportunities.

**2.5 Agentic RAG: A Paradigm Shift**

Traditional RAG systems, with their static workflows and limited adaptability, often struggle to handle dynamic, multi-step reasoning and complex real-world tasks. These limitations have spurred the integration of agentic intelligence, resulting in Agentic RAG. By incorporating autonomous agents capable of dynamic decision-making, iterative reasoning, and adaptive retrieval strategies, Agentic RAG builds on the modularity of earlier paradigms while overcoming their inherent constraints. This evolution enables more complex, multi-domain tasks to be addressed with enhanced precision and contextual understanding, positioning Agentic RAG as a cornerstone for next-generation AI applications. In

particular, Agentic RAG systems reduce latency through optimized workflows and refine outputs iteratively, tackling the very challenges that have historically hindered traditional RAG's scalability and effectiveness.

# 3 **Core Principles and Background of Agentic Intelligence**

Agentic Intelligence forms the foundation of Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, enabling them to transcend the static and reactive nature of traditional RAG. By integrating autonomous agents capable of dynamic decision-making, iterative reasoning, and collaborative workflows, Agentic RAG systems exhibit enhanced adaptability and precision. This section explores the core principles underpinning agentic intelligence.

## **Components of an AI Agent.** In essence, an AI agent comprises (Figure. 7):

- **LLM (with defined Role and Task):** Serves as the agent's primary reasoning engine and dialogue interface. It interprets user queries, generates responses, and maintains coherence.
- **Memory (Short-Term and Long-Term):** Captures context and relevant data across interactions. Short-term memory [23] tracks immediate conversation state, while long-term memory [23] stores accumulated knowledge and agent experiences.
- **Planning (Reflection & Self-Critique):** Guides the agent's iterative reasoning process through reflection, query routing, or self-critique[24], ensuring that complex tasks are broken down effectively [25].
- **Tools Vector Search, Web Search, APIs, etc.):** Expands the agent's capabilities beyond text generation, enabling access to external resources, real-time data, or specialized computations.

### Figure 7: An Overview of AI Agents

```

Agentic Patterns [26, 27] provide structured methodologies that guide the behavior of agents in Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. These patterns enable agents to dynamically adapt, plan, and collaborate, ensuring that the system can handle complex, real-world tasks with precision and scalability. Four key patterns underpin agentic workflows:

## 3.1 **Reflection**

Reflection is a foundational design pattern in agentic workflows, enabling agents to iteratively evaluate and refine their outputs. By incorporating self-feedback mechanisms, agents can identify and address errors, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement, enhancing performance across tasks like code generation, text production, and question answering ( as shown in Figure 8). In practical use, Reflection involves prompting an agent to critique its outputs for correctness, style, and efficiency, then incorporating this feedback into subsequent iterations. External tools, such as unit tests or web searches, can further enhance this process by validating results and highlighting gaps.

9





In multi-agent systems, **Reflection** can involve distinct roles, such as one agent generating outputs while another critiques them, fostering collaborative improvement. For instance, in legal research, agents can iteratively refine responses by re-evaluating retrieved case law, ensuring accuracy and comprehensiveness. Reflection has demonstrated significant performance improvements in studies like *Self-Refine* [28], *Reflexion* [29], and **CRITIC** [24].

```

**Figure 8:** An Overview of Agentic Self- Reflection

## 3.2 Planning

Planning [25] is a key design pattern in agentic workflows that enables agents to autonomously decompose complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. This capability is essential for multi-hop reasoning and iterative problem-solving in dynamic and uncertain scenarios as shown in Figure 9a.

By leveraging planning, agents can dynamically determine the sequence of steps needed to accomplish a larger objective. This adaptability allows agents to handle tasks that cannot be predefined, ensuring flexibility in decision-making. While powerful, Planning can produce less predictable outcomes compared to deterministic workflows like Reflection. Planning is particularly suited for tasks that require dynamic adaptation, where predefined workflows are insufficient. As the technology matures, its potential to drive innovative applications across domains will continue to grow.

Tool Use enables agents to extend their capabilities by interacting with external tools, APIs, or computational resources as illustrated in 9b. This pattern allows agents to gather information, perform computations, and manipulate data beyond their pre-trained knowledge. By dynamically integrating tools into workflows, agents can adapt to complex tasks and provide more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

Modern agentic workflows incorporate tool use for a variety of applications, including information retrieval, computational reasoning, and interfacing with external systems. The implementation of this pattern has evolved significantly with advancements like GPT-4's function calling capabilities and systems capable of managing access to numerous tools. These developments facilitate sophisticated workflows where agents autonomously select and execute the most relevant tools for a given task.

While tool use significantly enhances agentic workflows, challenges remain in optimizing the selection of tools, particularly in contexts with a large number of available options. Techniques inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), such as heuristic-based selection, have been proposed to address this issue.

# 3.4 **Multi-Agent**

Multi-agent collaboration [30] is a key design pattern in agentic workflows that enables task specialization and parallel processing. Agents communicate and share intermediate results, ensuring the overall workflow remains efficient and coherent. By distributing subtasks among specialized agents, this pattern improves the scalability and adaptability of complex workflows. Multi-agent systems allow developers to decompose intricate tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks assigned to different agents. This approach not only enhances task performance but also provides a robust framework for managing complex interactions. Each agent operates with its own memory and workflow, which can include the use of tools, reflection, or planning, enabling dynamic and collaborative problem-solving (see Figure 10).

While multi-agent collaboration offers significant potential, it is a less predictable design pattern compared to more mature workflows like Reflection and Tool Use. Nevertheless, emerging frameworks such as AutoGen, Crew AI, and LangGraph are providing new avenues for implementing effective multi-agent solutions.

| Stage   | Component  |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Query   | → Agent 1  |
| Agent 1 | → Response |
| Agent 1 | ↔ Agent 2  |
| Agent 1 | ↔ Agent 3  |


**Figure 10:** An Overview of MultiAgent

These design patterns form the foundation for the success of Agentic RAG systems. By structuring workflows—from simple, sequential steps to more adaptive, collaborative processes—these patterns enable systems to dynamically adapt their retrieval and generative strategies to the diverse and ever-changing demands of real-world environments. Leveraging these patterns, agents are capable of handling iterative, context-aware tasks that significantly exceed the capabilities of traditional RAG systems.

# 4 **Agentic Workflow Patterns: Adaptive Strategies for Dynamic Collaboration**

Agentic workflow patterns, [13, 31] structure LLM-based applications to optimize performance, accuracy, and efficiency. Different approaches are suitable depending on task complexity and processing requirements.

## 4.1 **Prompt Chaining: Enhancing Accuracy Through Sequential Processing**

Prompt chaining [13, 31] decomposes a complex task into multiple steps, where each step builds upon the previous one. This structured approach improves accuracy by simplifying each subtask before moving forward. However, it may increase latency due to sequential processing.

11





# Figure 11: Illustration of Prompt Chaining Workflow

**When to Use:** This workflow is most effective when a task can be broken down into fixed subtasks, each contributing to the final output. It is particularly useful in scenarios where step-by-step reasoning enhances accuracy.

**Example Applications:**
- Generating marketing content in one language and then translating it into another while preserving nuances.
- Structuring document creation by first generating an outline, verifying its completeness, and then developing the full text.

## 4.2 Routing: Directing Inputs to Specialized Processes

Routing [13, 31] involves classifying an input and directing it to an appropriate specialized prompt or process. This method ensures distinct queries or tasks are handled separately, improving efficiency and response quality.

# Figure 12: Illustration Routing Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
  N0[Query] --> N1[Router]
  N1[Router] --> N2[LLM1]
  N1[Router] --> N3[LLM2]
  N1[Router] --> N4[LLM3]
  N2[LLM1] --> N5[Response]
  N3[LLM2] --> N5[Response]
  N4[LLM3] --> N5[Response]
```

**When to Use:** Ideal for scenarios where different types of input require distinct handling strategies, ensuring optimized performance for each category.

**Example Applications:**
- Directing customer service queries into categories such as technical support, refund requests, or general inquiries.
- Assigning simple queries to smaller models for cost efficiency, while complex requests go to advanced models.

12





# 4.3 **Parallelization: Speeding Up Processing Through Concurrent Execution**

Parallelization [13, 31] divides a task into independent processes that run simultaneously, reducing latency and improving throughput. It can be categorized into sectioning (independent subtasks) and voting (multiple outputs for accuracy).

```mermaid
graph TD
  N0[Query] --> N1[LLM]
  N0[Query] --> N1[LLM]
  N0[Query] --> N1[LLM]
  N2[B] --> N3[Aggregator]
  N4[D] --> N5[G]
  N6[F] --> N5[G]
  N5[G] --> N0[Query]
```

**Figure 13: Illustration of Parallelization Workflow**

**When to Use:** Useful when tasks can be executed independently to enhance speed or when multiple outputs improve confidence.

**Example Applications:**
- **Sectioning:** Splitting tasks like content moderation, where one model screens input while another generates a response.
- **Voting:** Using multiple models to cross-check code for vulnerabilities or analyze content moderation decisions.

# 4.4 **Orchestrator-Workers: Dynamic Task Delegation**

This workflow [13, 31] features a central orchestrator model that dynamically breaks tasks into subtasks, assigns them to specialized worker models, and compiles the results. Unlike parallelization, it adapts to varying input complexity.

```mermaid
graph TD
  N0[Query] --> N1[Orchestrator]
  N1[Orchestrator] --> N2[LLM1]
  N1[Orchestrator] --> N3[LLM2]

  N2[LLM1] --> N5[Synthesizer]
  N3[LLM2] --> N5[Synthesizer]
  N4[LLM3] --> N5[Synthesizer]
  N5[Synthesizer] --> N6[Response]
```

**Figure 14: Illustration of Orchestrator-Workers Workflow**

**When to Use:** Best suited for tasks requiring dynamic decomposition and real-time adaptation, where subtasks are not predefined.

**Example Applications:**
- Automatically modifying multiple files in a codebase based on the nature of requested changes.

13





- Conducting real-time research by gathering and synthesizing relevant information from multiple sources.

## 4.5 **Evaluator-Optimizer: Refining Output Through Iteration**

The evaluator-optimizer [13, 31] workflow iteratively improves content by generating an initial output and refining it based on feedback from an evaluation model.

```mermaid
graph TD
  N0[Query] --> N1[Generator]
  N1[Generator] --> N2[Solution Evaluator]
  N3[Evaluator] --> N4[Accepted Response]
  N3[Evaluator] --> N5[Rejected+ Feedback Generator]
```

**Figure 15:** Illustration of Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow

**When to Use:** Effective when iterative refinement significantly enhances response quality, especially when clear evaluation criteria exist.

**Example Applications:**
- Improving literary translations through multiple evaluation and refinement cycles.
- Conducting multi-round research queries where additional iterations refine search results.

## 5 **Taxonomy of Agentic RAG Systems**

Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can be categorized into distinct architectural frameworks based on their complexity and design principles. These include single-agent architectures, multi-agent systems, and hierarchical agentic architectures. Each framework is tailored to address specific challenges and optimize performance for diverse applications. This section provides a detailed taxonomy of these architectures, highlighting their characteristics, strengths, and limitations.

### 5.1 **Single-Agent Agentic RAG: Router**

**A Single-Agent Agentic RAG:** [32] serves as a centralized decision-making system where a single agent manages the retrieval, routing, and integration of information (as shown in Figure. 16). This architecture simplifies the system by consolidating these tasks into one unified agent, making it particularly effective for setups with a limited number of tools or data sources.

## Workflow

1. **Query Submission and Evaluation:** The process begins when a user submits a query. A coordinating agent (or master retrieval agent) receives the query and analyzes it to determine the most suitable sources of information.
2. **Knowledge Source Selection:** Based on the query's type, the coordinating agent chooses from a variety of retrieval options:
   - **Structured Databases:** For queries requiring tabular data access, the system may use a *Text-to-SQL* engine that interacts with databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

14





- **Semantic Search:** When dealing with unstructured information, it retrieves relevant documents (e.g., PDFs, books, organizational records) using vector-based retrieval.
- **Web Search:** For real-time or broad contextual information, the system leverages a web search tool to access the latest online data.
- **Recommendation Systems:** For personalized or contextual queries, the system taps into recommendation engines that provide tailored suggestions.

3. **Data Integration and LLM Synthesis:** Once the relevant data is retrieved from the chosen sources, it is *passed to a Large Language Model (LLM)*. The LLM synthesizes the gathered information, integrating insights from multiple sources into a coherent and contextually relevant response.

4. **Output Generation:** Finally, the system delivers a comprehensive, user-facing answer that addresses the original query. This response is presented in an actionable, concise format and may optionally include references or citations to the sources used.

```mermaid
graph TD
  N0[Input] --> N1[Query]
  N1[Query] --> N2[Prompt]
  N2[Prompt] --> N3[Retrieval Router Agent]
  N3[Retrieval Router Agent] --> N4[LLM]
  N4[LLM] --> N5[Response]
  N3[Retrieval Router Agent] --> N6[Tools]
  N6[Tools] --> N7[Vector Search X]
  N6[Tools] --> N8[Vector Search Y]
  N6[Tools] --> N9[Web Search]
  N7[Vector Search X] --> N10[Data Sources 1]
  N8[Vector Search Y] --> N11[Data Sources 2]
```

Figure 16: An Overview of Single Agentic RAG

## **Key Features and Advantages.**

- **Centralized Simplicity:** A single agent handles all retrieval and routing tasks, making the architecture straightforward to design, implement, and maintain.

- **Efficiency & Resource Optimization:** With fewer agents and simpler coordination, the system demands fewer computational resources and can handle queries more quickly.

- **Dynamic Routing:** The agent evaluates each query in real-time, selecting the most appropriate knowledge source (e.g., structured DB, semantic search, web search).

- **Versatility Across Tools:** Supports a variety of data sources and external APIs, enabling both structured and unstructured workflows.

## 5.2 Multi-Agent Agentic RAG Systems:

**Multi-Agent RAG [32]** represents a modular and scalable evolution of single-agent architectures, designed to handle complex workflows and diverse query types by leveraging multiple specialized agents (as shown in Figure 17). Instead of relying on a single agent to manage all tasks—reasoning, retrieval, and response generation—this system distributes responsibilities across multiple agents, each optimized for a specific role or data source.

## Workflow

1. **Query Submission:** The process begins with a user query, which is received by a *coordinator agent* or master retrieval agent. This agent acts as the central orchestrator, delegating the query to specialized retrieval agents based on the query's requirements.

2. **Specialized Retrieval Agents:** The query is distributed among multiple retrieval agents, each focusing on a specific type of data source or task. Examples include:
   - **Agent 1:** Handles structured queries, such as interacting with SQL-based databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
   - **Agent 2:** Manages semantic searches for retrieving unstructured data from sources like PDFs, books, or internal records.
   - **Agent 3:** Focuses on retrieving real-time public information from web searches or APIs.
   - **Agent 4:** Specializes in recommendation systems, delivering context-aware suggestions based on user behavior or profiles.

3. **Tool Access and Data Retrieval:** Each agent routes the query to the appropriate tools or data sources within its domain, such as:
   - *Vector Search:* For semantic relevance.
   - *Text-to-SQL:* For structured data.
   - *Web Search:* For real-time public information.
   - *APIs:* For accessing external services or proprietary systems.

The retrieval process is executed in parallel, allowing for efficient processing of diverse query types.

Economically, renewable energy investments have generated approximately 1.2 million jobs, with significant growth in solar and wind sectors. Recent academic studies also highlight potential trade-offs in grid stability and energy storage costs."

## 5.3 Hierarchical Agentic RAG Systems

**Hierarchical Agentic RAG:** [15] systems employ a structured, multi-tiered approach to information retrieval and processing, enhancing both efficiency and strategic decision-making as shown in Figure 18. Agents are organized in a hierarchy, with higher-level agents overseeing and directing lower-level agents. This structure enables multi-level decision-making, ensuring that queries are handled by the most appropriate resources.

```mermaid
graph TD
  N0[Query] --> N1[Master Agent]
  N1[Master Agent] --> N2[Response]
  N1[Master Agent] --> N3[Sub-Agent X]
  N1[Master Agent] --> N4[Sub-Agent Y]
  N1[Master Agent] --> N5[Sub-Agent Z]
```

Figure 18: An illustration of Hierarchical Agentic RAG

## Workflow

1. **Query Reception:** A user submits a query, received by a *top-tier agent* responsible for initial assessment and delegation.
2. **Strategic Decision-Making:** The top-tier agent evaluates the query's complexity and decides which subordinate agents or data sources to prioritize. Certain databases, APIs, or retrieval tools may be deemed more reliable or relevant based on the query's domain.
3. **Delegation to Subordinate Agents:** The top-tier agent assigns tasks to lower-level agents specialized in particular retrieval methods (e.g., SQL databases, web search, or proprietary systems). These agents execute their assigned tasks independently.

18





4. **Aggregation and Synthesis:** The results from subordinate agents are collected and integrated by the higher-level agent, which synthesizes the information into a coherent response.

5. **Response Delivery:** The final, synthesized answer is returned to the user, ensuring that the response is both comprehensive and contextually relevant.

## **Key Features and Advantages.**

- **Strategic Prioritization:** Top-tier agents can prioritize data sources or tasks based on query complexity, reliability, or context.
- **Scalability:** Distributing tasks across multiple agent tiers enables handling of highly complex or multi-faceted queries.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Higher-level agents apply strategic oversight to improve overall accuracy and coherence of responses.

## Challenges

## 5.4 Agentic Corrective RAG

**Corrective RAG:** introduces mechanisms to self-correct retrieval results, enhancing document utilization and improving response generation quality as demonstrated in Figure 19. By embedding intelligent agents into the workflow, Corrective RAG [33] [34] ensures iterative refinement of context documents and responses, minimizing errors and maximizing relevance.

## **Key Idea of Corrective RAG:** The core principle of Corrective RAG lies in its ability to evaluate retrieved documents dynamically, perform corrective actions, and refine queries to enhance the quality of generated responses. Corrective RAG adjusts its approach as follows:

- **Document Relevance Evaluation:** Retrieved documents are assessed for relevance by the *Relevance Evaluation Agent*. Documents below the relevance threshold trigger corrective steps.
- **Query Refinement and Augmentation:** Queries are refined by the *Query Refinement Agent*, which leverages semantic understanding to optimize retrieval for better results.

```

Figure 19: Overview of Agentic Corrective RAG

- **Dynamic Retrieval from External Sources:** When context is insufficient, the *External Knowledge Retrieval Agent* performs web searches or accesses alternative data sources to supplement the retrieved documents.

- **Response Synthesis:** All validated and refined information is passed to the *Response Synthesis Agent* for final response generation.

**Workflow:** The Corrective RAG system is built on five key agents:

1. **Context Retrieval Agent:** Responsible for retrieving initial context documents from a vector database.
2. **Relevance Evaluation Agent:** Assesses the retrieved documents for relevance and flags any irrelevant or ambiguous documents for corrective actions.
3. **Query Refinement Agent:** Rewrites queries to improve retrieval, leveraging semantic understanding to optimize results.
4. **External Knowledge Retrieval Agent:** Performs web searches or accesses alternative data sources when the context documents are insufficient.
5. **Response Synthesis Agent:** Synthesizes all validated information into a coherent and accurate response.

**Key Features and Advantages:**

- **Iterative Correction:** Ensures high response accuracy by dynamically identifying and correcting irrelevant or ambiguous retrieval results.
- **Dynamic Adaptability:** Incorporates real-time web searches and query refinement for enhanced retrieval precision.
- **Agentic Modularity:** Each agent performs specialized tasks, ensuring efficient and scalable operation.
- **Factuality Assurance:** By validating all retrieved and generated content, Corrective RAG minimizes the risk of hallucination or misinformation.

**Figure 20:** An Overview of Adaptive Agentic RAG

## **Key Idea of Adaptive RAG**
The core principle of Adaptive RAG lies in its ability to dynamically tailor retrieval strategies based on the complexity of the query. Adaptive RAG adjusts its approach as follows:

21





- **Straightforward Queries:** For fact-based questions that require no additional retrieval (e.g., *"What is the *boiling point of water?*"*), the system directly generates an answer using pre-existing knowledge.

- **Simple Queries:** For moderately complex tasks requiring minimal context (e.g., *"What is the *status of my latest electricity bill?*"*), the system performs a single-step retrieval to fetch the relevant details.

- **Complex Queries:** For multi-layered queries requiring iterative reasoning (e.g., *"How has the *population of City X* changed over the *past decade*, and what are the *contributing factors?*"*), the system employs multi-step retrieval, progressively refining intermediate results to provide a comprehensive answer.

**Workflow:** The Adaptive RAG system is built on three primary components:

1. **Classifier Role:**
   - A smaller language model analyzes the query to predict its complexity.
   - The classifier is trained using automatically labeled datasets, derived from past model outcomes and query patterns.

2. **Dynamic Strategy Selection:**
   - For straightforward queries, the system avoids unnecessary retrieval, directly leveraging the LLM for response generation.
   - For simple queries, it employs a single-step retrieval process to fetch relevant context.
   - For complex queries, it activates multi-step retrieval to ensure iterative refinement and enhanced reasoning.

3. **LLM Integration:**
   - The LLM synthesizes retrieved information into a coherent response.
   - Iterative interactions between the LLM and the classifier enable refinement for complex queries.

**Key Features and Advantages**

- **Dynamic Adaptability:** Adjusts retrieval strategies based on query complexity, optimizing both computational efficiency and response accuracy.

- **Resource Efficiency:** Minimizes unnecessary overhead for simple queries while ensuring thorough processing for complex ones.

- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Iterative refinement ensures that complex queries are resolved with high precision.

Based on the analysis of paradigms, taxonomies, and real-world use cases, this section distills practical insights for designing, evaluating, and deploying Agentic RAG systems.

### 10.1 Agentic RAG Is Not Always the Right Default

Agentic RAG should not be viewed as a universal replacement for traditional RAG. While it offers superior adaptability and multi-step reasoning, it also introduces coordination complexity, latency, and computational cost. For simple fact retrieval or well-scoped queries, modular RAG pipelines provide sufficient performance with lower overhead. Practitioners should adopt agentic designs selectively, guided by task complexity.

### 10.2 Architectural Choice Strongly Shapes System Behavior

Different architectures lead to fundamentally different behaviors. Single-agent systems favor simplicity; multi-agent systems enable parallelism but require orchestration; hierarchical architectures introduce oversight at the expense

of complexity. Architectural decisions implicitly encode assumptions about control, trust, and error tolerance—corrective workflows improve accuracy but add latency, while adaptive architectures trade correctness guarantees for responsiveness.

## 10.3 **Retrieval Quality Remains the Primary Bottleneck**

Agentic reasoning cannot compensate for consistently poor retrieval. Failures often originate from inadequate retrieval coverage, poorly constructed indexes, or insufficient integration of structured and unstructured knowledge. Investing in robust retrieval pipelines and high-quality indexing before introducing agentic complexity remains essential.

## 10.4 **Agent Autonomy Requires Explicit Constraints**

Unrestricted autonomy risks excessive tool invocation, redundant reasoning loops, or misaligned objectives. Effective systems balance autonomy with bounded planning horizons, predefined tool access policies, and explicit stopping criteria. Constrained autonomy yields more reliable outcomes, especially in production environments.

## 10.5 **Evaluation Must Account for Process, Not Just Outcomes**

Existing benchmarks focus on output quality with limited visibility into intermediate decisions. Meaningful evaluation requires process-level metrics capturing reasoning efficiency, tool usage patterns, and adaptation to changing contexts. Without such evaluation, improvements risk being anecdotal rather than systematic.

## 10.6 **Domain Knowledge Significantly Amplifies Agentic Benefits**

Agentic RAG achieves its strongest gains in domains with structured knowledge and explicit constraints. Healthcare, finance, and legal analysis particularly benefit from combining retrieval with rule-based reasoning and graph-structured knowledge. Open-domain tasks show more modest gains, underscoring domain modeling as a complementary component of Agentic RAG design.

# 10.7 **Toward Responsible Deployment of Agentic RAG**

Agentic RAG introduces challenges in transparency, accountability, and trust. Multi-agent collaboration complicates error attribution, while autonomous tool use raises safety concerns. Responsible deployment requires governance mechanisms, human oversight, and clear operational boundaries. Explainability, traceability, and auditability must be first-class design goals, particularly for high-stakes applications.

# **11 Benchmarks and Datasets**

Current benchmarks [57] and datasets evaluate RAG systems across retrieval, reasoning, and generation. Table 5 summarizes key datasets by downstream task. The following benchmarks are particularly relevant:

- ***BEIR*** (*Benchmarking Information Retrieval*): A benchmark for evaluating embedding models across 17 datasets in bioinformatics, finance, and question answering [58].
- ***MS MARCO*** (*Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension*): Passage ranking and question answering, widely used for dense retrieval evaluation in RAG systems [59].

# **12 Open Research Issues and Future Challenges in Agentic RAG**

Despite rapid progress in Agentic RAG, the field remains at an early stage of maturity. While existing systems demonstrate clear advantages over traditional RAG pipelines, they also expose a range of unresolved research challenges that must be addressed to enable robust, scalable, and trustworthy deployment in real-world settings. This section outlines key open research issues and articulates a long-term research vision for Agentic RAG systems.

## **12.1 Agent Coordination, Control, and Emergent Behavior**

As systems scale to multi-agent and hierarchical frameworks, emergent behaviors become difficult to predict. Current orchestration relies on heuristic rules and prompt engineering with limited convergence guarantees. Future research must address coordination under partial observability and conflicting objectives, formally model inter-agent dependencies, prevent cascading failures, and ensure verifiable collaborative outcomes.

## **12.2 Evaluation Methodologies Beyond Output Quality**

Output-level metrics (answer correctness, retrieval accuracy) are insufficient for Agentic RAG, where intermediate decisions shape performance. Standardized benchmarks evaluating reasoning trajectories, planning depth, adaptability, robustness under noisy retrieval, and cost efficiency are needed. Process-aware evaluation assessing *how* answers are produced is essential for systematic progress.

**12.3 Memory Management and Long-Term Adaptation**

Long-term memory design remains open challenge. Persistent memory risks knowledge drift and bias reinforcement, while frequent updates can amplify hallucinations. Key questions include balancing persistence with adaptability, selective retention, and reconciling external knowledge with stored agent experiences.

**12.4 Computational Cost, Efficiency, and Sustainability**

Multi-agent collaboration and iterative retrieval increase latency and resource consumption. Future research must explore cost-aware planning, adaptive inference, and lightweight coordination—dynamically adjusting active agents, selectively invoking tools, and optimizing retrieval depth based on task complexity.

**12.5 Safety, Trust, and Governance in Autonomous RAG Systems**

Autonomous agents may introduce failure modes including unauthorized actions and biased decisions. In multi-agent settings, tracing responsibility is particularly challenging. Open directions include transparent decision-tracing, human-

in-the-loop oversight, and governance frameworks ensuring alignment between agent objectives and human intent in high-stakes applications.

## 12.6 Generalization Across Domains and Tasks

Most existing Agentic RAG systems are evaluated in domain-specific settings or carefully curated benchmarks. It remains unclear how well these systems generalize across domains with differing data characteristics, regulatory constraints, or reasoning requirements. Designing agents that can adapt their retrieval and reasoning strategies without extensive task-specific tuning is an open problem. Future work should focus on developing domain-agnostic agentic abstractions, transferable planning strategies, and adaptive retrieval policies that generalize beyond narrow application contexts. Achieving robust cross-domain generalization will be essential for realizing the full potential of Agentic RAG as a general-purpose reasoning framework.

## 13 Conclusion

Agentic RAG represents a significant evolution beyond static RAG pipelines toward autonomous, adaptive reasoning frameworks. This survey examined RAG foundations, agentic intelligence integration, and the architectural patterns defining modern Agentic RAG systems. By organizing approaches through a principled taxonomy based on agent cardinality, control structure, autonomy, and knowledge representation, this work provides a structured view of a fragmented landscape. The analysis demonstrates that no single architecture is universally optimal; effectiveness depends on aligning complexity with task requirements. Agentic RAG offers clear advantages for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks in healthcare, finance, education, and enterprise processing, but these benefits require high-quality retrieval foundations, disciplined autonomy, and careful orchestration.

Substantial open challenges remain in multi-agent coordination, process-aware evaluation, memory management, computational efficiency, and governance. This survey consolidates existing work, introduces a unifying framework, and articulates design trade-offs and research directions to advance the field of Agentic RAG.
